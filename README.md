# üîß Predictive Maintenance Using IBM Watsonx.ai

A cloud-based machine learning project built using **IBM Watsonx.ai**, designed to predict potential failures in industrial machines using historical sensor data.

üöÄ **Deployed on IBM Cloud** | üìä **Model Training** |

---

## üë©‚Äçüíª About the Project

This project automates **predictive maintenance** by analyzing sensor data (temperature, vibration, pressure, etc.) from industrial machines and predicting failure types like:
- Tool wear
- Power failure
- Overheating

Developed using IBM Watsonx.ai Studio, the model was trained, optimized, and deployed without writing manual ML code. The result is a production-ready pipeline that supports real-time failure predictions to reduce downtime and improve operational efficiency.

## üìé Project Summary

> I developed an end-to-end **Predictive Maintenance solution** using **IBM Watsonx.ai AutoAI**, aimed at anticipating machine failures (such as tool wear, overheating, and power issues) before they occur. The project involved analyzing real-world industrial sensor data (temperature, vibration, pressure, etc.) to train classification models without manual coding.  
>
> Using **AutoAI**, I automated the entire ML lifecycle ‚Äî from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model selection and hyperparameter optimization. The best-performing model (Random Forest) was deployed using **IBM Watson Machine Learning**, enabling real-time prediction through a scalable cloud-based API.  
>
> This project demonstrates my ability to leverage **AutoML platforms**, work with **cloud-based ML tools**, and build practical AI solutions for the manufacturing industry ‚Äî with a focus on reliability, scalability, and proactive problem-solving.
